# wurmonlinemaps-ng

This is the Angular client-side code base for the Xanadu map used at WurmOnlineMaps.com. (The server-side code is used only for the management of map data telemetry.)

## Angular CLI
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0

## Map Data
Map data is managed via another app with a REST-enabled endpoint at [Map Data API](http://wurmonlinemaps.com/api/data/Xanadu).

## Open Layers 3
Open Layers 3.8.2 implemeted via CDN connected script and CSS files. There are no typings/angular modules or components for any NG OL3 implementation.  

Hence this declaration in components:

```typescript
declare var ol: any;
```
## Map origins
The tileset layer(s) were generated by 8192 x 8192 pixel map dumps created by the Wurm Online dev team.
